		- This module has two versions from Adafruit, the original and STEMMA QT versions. 
		- The SEMMA QT version does not have external breakouts for adress setting pins. 
		- It instead contains solder jumpers to set these values with 10K pulldown resistors on non-jumped pins.
		- STEMMA QT connector format is intended to be compativel with Sparkfun's Quiik connect system.
			- Allows for making a quick I2C bus without soldered connections
